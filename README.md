# Project #2 - Show Me The Data Structures
## Udacity Nanodegree - Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo contains projects that I am working on as part of this course.

Please note that these solutions have been written by me as part of my learning.

While you are free to refer to the solutions here to further your own understanding or clarify any questions you might have,
plagiarism of this code explicity violates the [Udacity Honor Code](https://www.udacity.com/legal/en-us/honor-code).

Please be true to yourself and write your own solutions to the problems and do not copy the code provided here.

## Instructions

Install the dependencies for Unit Testing
```bash
$ pip install pytest --user
```

Test the code
```bash
$ pytest problem_1_test.py # for a single test
$ pytest # for all tests
```

You can also run the test code samples without doing a 'unittest'
```bash
$ python problem_1_test.py -v # run a single test case
```

Or launch and run the jupyter notebook files where available
```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

## Problems and Solutions
